## Installation
To install the interpreter locally:
1. Download the .zip of this repository
2. Add the path to this repository to your system's PATH environment variable (point to the root folder)
3. To run an example file, open CMD and navigate to the root folder of the unzipped repository
4. In CMD, type `mplee example.mplee` - this should display a sorted array
You can create .mplee files in any directory and execute them from their location, similar to Python files.

**Fun Fact:** The mplee interpreter can also execute Python files! Try running `mplee test.py` and it should work seamlessly.

## Description

mplee is a programming language created for educational purposes. The personal goal was to learn how interpreters work and understand the internals of such systems.

**Project Goal:** The main objective was to create a language that's simple to interact with and notably faster than Python.

Language examples can be found in the `documentation` folder and the `grammar.txt` file.
